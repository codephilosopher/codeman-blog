> how to create a simple CMake with minimal configuration

* create a file **CMakeLists.txt** in your current project folder.
* first thing in cmake is, you need to specify what version you are targeting for your cmake.

  in my case it will be 3.22.1, so the line of code we need to add is `cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.22.1 FATAL_ERROR)` we can pass   `FATAL_ERROR` if the minimum requirement lower than that is used.
* next we need to specify that project name, for that we use these line of code `project(hello-world LANGUAGES CXX)` to your CMakeLists.txt file. also we need to pass the supported language. In this case its CPP.
* next we need to specify the new target executable file. This will be generated by compiling and linking the source file lets say **hello_world.cpp**. cmake will use default settings for compiling. 

  * enter these line of code to add new executable `add_executable(hello_world hello_world.cpp)` 
* now we build source file by running `cmake .` on our terminal . 
* then this will generate makefile , we can run `make` to generate a executable file.
