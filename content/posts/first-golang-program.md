It is the custom to start a program by printing "Hello World!" ðŸ˜Š

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello World!")
}
```

* Every Go program starts with a package name, This is a main program which drives other programs, so this has the main package name. 
* ***func main***   is the entry point to go program for operating system. From this main function, all other programs are called and executed.
* Functions have opening and closing curly braces. Inside the main function, we write all other code. 
* ***fmt*** is a package name like main,  a group of similar related functions are grouped under a package name directory. Here ***Println*** function is put under ***fmt*** package. ***fmt.Println()***  will print to the standard out streams like terminal.
* ***import "fmt"*** is the package import statement in Go, We can import multiple package import declaration in side a opening and closing parenthesis.
* To run a go program, we need to type and enter these line of code in your terminal `go run source_file.go`
