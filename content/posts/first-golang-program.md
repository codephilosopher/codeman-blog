It is the custom to start a program by printing "Hello World!" ðŸ˜Š

`package main`

`import "fmt"`

`func main() {`

`fmt.Println("Hello World!")`

`}` 

* Every Go program starts with a package name, This is a main program which drives other programs, so this has the main package name. 
* ***func main***   is the entry point to go program for operating system. From this main function, all other programs are called and executed.
* Functions have opening and closing curly braces. Inside the main function, we write all other code. 
* ***fmt*** is a package name like main,  a group of similar related functions are grouped under a package name directory. Here ***Println*** function is put under ***fmt*** package. ***fmt.Println()***  will print to the standard out streams like terminal.
